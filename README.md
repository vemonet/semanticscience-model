# Semanticscience Integrated Ontology

The Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO) provides a simple, integrated ontology of types and relations for rich description of objects, processes and their attributes.

This repository uses [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/linkml) to implement the SIO ontology.

> Work in progress: not all SIO has been defined in this LinkML model

Source ontology: https://semanticscience.org

Docs generated by LinkML: https://vemonet.github.io/semanticscience-model

## Install

Pipenv is required to build the files from the LinkML models:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Install LinkML with `pipenv`:

```bash
pipenv install linkml
```

Make sure the `make` command is available, on Ubuntu you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## Build model files

Files are generated in the `semanticscience_model` folder.

Generate all artefacts (OWL, SHACL, ShEx, classes...) from the YAML model:

```bash
make
```

Generate docs:

```bash
make docs
```

Clean the cache:

```bash
make clean
```

Check the `Makefile` file if you need to make changes to the process.

## Autocomplete for the model YAML

For **VisualStudio Code** users: add autocomplete and validation for LinkML model files in VisualStudio Code easily with the [YAML extension from RedHat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml). 

1. Go to VisualStudio Code, and open the **Command Palette** in **View** or with `Ctrl+Shift+P` 

2. Search for `Open Settings (JSON)`

3. Then add the following lines to the `settings.json` :

```json
    "yaml.schemas": {
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vemonet/semanticscience-model/master/resources/linkml.schema.json": ["model/*-model.yml"],
    }
```

## Use custom LinkML

You might want to bring improvements to the LinkML schema generation, to do so, clone its repo in the parent directory and install LinkML from source:

```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/linkml/linkml
cd semanticscience-model
pipenv install ../linkml
```
