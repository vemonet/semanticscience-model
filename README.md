# 🔬 SemanticScience Integrated Ontology

[![Build and publish SIO model](https://github.com/vemonet/semanticscience-model/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vemonet/semanticscience-model/actions/workflows/main.yaml)

The Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (**SIO**) provides a simple, integrated ontology of types and relations for rich description of objects, processes and their attributes.

This repository uses [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/linkml) to implement the SIO ontology.

The LinkML model YAML for SIO is defined in [`model/sio-model.yaml`](https://github.com/vemonet/semanticscience-model/blob/main/model/sio-model.yaml)

📖 The docs generated by LinkML is available at https://vemonet.github.io/semanticscience-model/index

> ⚠️ Work in progress: not all SIO has been defined in this LinkML model

## Install

Requirement: Python >= 3.7

Pipenv is required to build the files from the LinkML models:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Install LinkML with `pipenv`:

```bash
pipenv install linkml
```

Make sure the `make` command is available, on Debian/Ubuntu you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```

## Build model files

Generate all artefacts from the YAML model in the `semanticscience_model` folder (OWL, SHACL, ShEx, JSON-LD context, Python classes...):

```bash
make
```

Generate the model documentation in the `docs` folder:

```bash
make docs
```

Clean the `target` folder:

```bash
make clean
```

Check the `Makefile` file if you need to make changes to the process.

## Autocomplete for the model YAML

For **VisualStudio Code** users: add autocomplete and validation for LinkML model files in VisualStudio Code easily with the [YAML extension from RedHat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml). 

1. Go to VisualStudio Code, and open the **Command Palette** in the **View** menu, or with `Ctrl+Shift+P` 

2. Search for **`Open Settings (JSON)`**

3. Then add the following lines to the `settings.json` :

```json
    "yaml.schemas": {
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vemonet/semanticscience-model/master/resources/linkml.schema.json": ["model/*-model.yml"],
    }
```

## Use a custom LinkML

You might want to bring improvements to the LinkML schema generation and use this new version. To do so, clone the LinkML repo in the parent directory of `semanticscience-model`, and install LinkML from source:

```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/linkml/linkml
cd semanticscience-model
pipenv install ../linkml
```
